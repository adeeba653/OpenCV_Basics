# Image Preprocessing with OpenCV (Basics)
This repo is just a simple collection of basic image preprocessing tasks I tried out using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. I did this to practice and show that I’m familiar with common image processing techniques used in computer vision.

# What I’ve Done
Here are some tasks I’ve implemented:
- Convert image to grayscale
- Resize and scale images
- Blur images (Gaussian, median, etc.)
- Apply thresholding (simple and adaptive)
- Detect edges (Canny)
- Do morphological operations (erosion, dilation)
- Convert color spaces (like BGR to HSV)
- Rotate, flip, and crop images
- Find and draw contours

Each task is done in a separate Python script.

# Tools Used
- Python
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
