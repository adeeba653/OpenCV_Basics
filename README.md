# OpenCV_Basics
This project includes simple image processing tasks using Python, OpenCV, and NumPy. It’s great if you’re just starting out and want to learn how to work with images using code.

🔧 What’s Included?
Here are some of the basic tasks I’ve done:

Convert images to grayscale

Resize images

Blur and smooth images

Apply different types of thresholding

Detect edges using Canny

Do erosion and dilation (morphology)

Convert between color formats (like BGR to HSV)

Rotate, crop, and flip images

Find and draw contours

These are helpful for learning computer vision and image analysis.

🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy
